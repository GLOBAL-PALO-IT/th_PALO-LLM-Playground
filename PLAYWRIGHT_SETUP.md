# Playwright E2E Testing - Summary

## What Was Added

This implementation adds comprehensive end-to-end (e2e) testing infrastructure using Playwright to the PALO-LLM-Playground project.

### Files Added

#### Configuration
- **`playwright.config.ts`** - Main Playwright configuration
  - Configures test directory, browser targets (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
  - Sets up dev server to run automatically before tests
  - Configures retries, timeouts, and reporters

#### Test Files (tests/e2e/)
1. **`homepage.spec.ts`** - Tests for homepage redirect behavior
2. **`chat.spec.ts`** - Tests for the Chat page
3. **`rag-agentic.spec.ts`** - Tests for the RAG Agentic page
4. **`navigation.spec.ts`** - Tests for navigation between pages
5. **`health-check.spec.ts`** - Basic application health checks
6. **`examples.spec.ts`** - Example tests demonstrating common patterns

#### Documentation
- **`tests/README.md`** - Comprehensive guide for running and writing tests
- **`tests/PLAYWRIGHT_GUIDE.md`** - Quick reference for Playwright commands and patterns

#### CI/CD
- **`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow for running tests

#### Updates
- **`package.json`** - Added test scripts and Playwright dependency
- **`.gitignore`** - Added Playwright artifacts to ignore list
- **`README.md`** - Added testing section

## Test Coverage

### Pages Tested
- ✅ Homepage (redirect to /ragAgentic)
- ✅ Chat page
- ✅ RAG Agentic page
- ✅ Navigation between pages
- ✅ 404 error handling

### Test Categories
1. **Functional Tests**
   - Page loading and rendering
   - Navigation and routing
   - URL verification

2. **Quality Tests**
   - Console error monitoring
   - Network error detection
   - HTML structure validation

3. **Responsive Tests**
   - Desktop viewport (1920x1080)
   - Tablet viewport (768x1024)
   - Mobile viewport (375x667)

4. **Performance Tests**
   - Page load time monitoring
   - Network idle state verification

## How to Use

### First-Time Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install Playwright browsers
npm run playwright:install
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with UI (interactive mode)
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Debug tests
npm run test:e2e:debug

# View report
npm run test:e2e:report
```

### Writing New Tests

1. Create a new file in `tests/e2e/` with `.spec.ts` extension
2. Import Playwright test utilities:
```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';
```

3. Write your tests:
```typescript
test.describe('My Feature', () => {
  test('should work correctly', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/my-page');
    expect(page.url()).toContain('/my-page');
  });
});
```

4. Run your tests:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## CI/CD Integration

Tests automatically run on:
- Push to `main` or `master` branches
- Pull requests to `main` or `master` branches

The workflow:
1. Installs dependencies
2. Installs Playwright browsers
3. Runs all tests
4. Uploads test reports as artifacts

## Key Features

### Auto-Start Dev Server
The Playwright config automatically starts the Next.js dev server before running tests and shuts it down after. No need to manually start the server!

### Multiple Browsers
Tests run on three browser engines:
- Chromium (Chrome/Edge)
- Firefox
- WebKit (Safari)

### Smart Retries
Tests automatically retry on CI to handle flaky tests (2 retries on CI, 0 locally).

### Comprehensive Reporting
- HTML report with screenshots and traces
- Detailed test results
- Performance metrics

## Best Practices Implemented

1. ✅ **No hard-coded waits** - Uses proper Playwright waiting mechanisms
2. ✅ **Organized test structure** - Tests grouped by feature/page
3. ✅ **Descriptive test names** - Clear intent for each test
4. ✅ **Error filtering** - Ignores harmless errors (favicon, etc.)
5. ✅ **Responsive testing** - Tests multiple viewport sizes
6. ✅ **Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and examples

## Next Steps

To extend the test suite:

1. **Add more page tests** - Test other pages in the application
2. **Add interaction tests** - Test form submissions, button clicks, etc.
3. **Add API mocking** - Mock API responses for consistent testing
4. **Add visual regression tests** - Screenshot comparison tests
5. **Add accessibility tests** - Test for WCAG compliance

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Installation Issues
If browser installation fails:
```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

### Port Already in Use
Stop any running dev servers on port 3000 before running tests.

### Tests Timeout
Increase timeout in `playwright.config.ts` if needed.
