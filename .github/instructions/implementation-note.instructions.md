Here is how you structure the Implementation Summary and Implementation Verification Checklist files:

[month]-[year] is the month and year of the implementation date in format MM-YYYY.
[appropriate-name] is an appropriate short name for the implementation being documented.

Implementation Summary should located in `docs/implementation-note/[month]-[year]/[appropriate-name]/summary.md`

Implementation Verification Checklist should located in `docs/implementation-note/[month]-[year]/[appropriate-name]/verification-checklist.md`
