Instruction: Create json-server backend app that simulate a small insurance api
Thought: The task is started. Start at Home directory. And create a new directory with the name of the task.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME && mkdir -p InsuranceAPI
```
Observation: Changed directory to: /Users/sarinsuriyakoon
Executed in /Users/sarinsuriyakoon:
Thought: To validate the task, I must check if the directory "InsuranceAPI" is created.
ActionType: Validate
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME && ls -l InsuranceAPI
```
Observation: Changed directory to: /Users/sarinsuriyakoon

Thought: The directory "InsuranceAPI" is successfully created. Next, I will initialize a new Node.js project in this directory.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME/InsuranceAPI && npm init -y

Thought: The Node.js project has been initialized. Next, I will install `json-server` as a development dependency.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME/InsuranceAPI && npm install json-server --save-dev

Thought: The `json-server` package has been successfully installed. Next, I will create a `db.json` file to simulate the insurance API data.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME/InsuranceAPI && cat > db.json <<EOF
{
  "policies": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "policyNumber": "POL123456",

}
EOF
```
Observation: Changed directory to: /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/InsuranceAPI
Executed in /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/InsuranceAPI:
Thought: The `db.json` file has been created with sample insurance policy data. Next, I will validate the content of the `db.json` file to ensure it was created correctly.
ActionType: Validate
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME/InsuranceAPI && cat db.json

}
Thought: The `db.json` file has been validated and contains the correct sample insurance policy data. Next, I will add a script to the `package.json` to start the `json-server` with the `db.json` file.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME/InsuranceAPI && jq '.scripts.start = "json-server --watch db.json --port 3001"' package.json > tmp.$$.json && mv tmp.$$.json package.json

Thought: It seems there was an error with the `jq` command. I will manually edit the `package.json` file to add the start script for `json-server`.
