Langchain JS is a JavaScript library designed to facilitate the development of language models and natural language processing (NLP) applications. It provides tools and utilities for building, training, and deploying language models, making it easier for developers to create sophisticated NLP solutions. Key features include support for various language models, integration with popular machine learning frameworks, and utilities for data preprocessing and model evaluation.

Thought: The previous attempt to write the research summary to the "research.txt" file failed due to a syntax error. I will correct the command by using `cat << 'EOF'` instead of `cat 'EOF'` to properly handle the multi-line input.
