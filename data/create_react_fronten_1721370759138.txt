Error executing command in /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/MazeGame: Command failed: npx create-react-app maze-game
Thought: There seems to be a persistent issue with creating the React app using `npx create-react-app`. I will check the error logs to understand the issue better.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME/MazeGame [&&/] tail -n 20 npm-debug.log
