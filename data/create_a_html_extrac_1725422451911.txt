Thought: The directory is successfully created. Now, I will create a bash script named `extract_links.sh` to extract all the links from a webpage.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME/HtmlExtractScript [&&/] cat << 'EOF' > extract_links.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Check if URL is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <URL>"
  exit 1
fi

# Fetch the webpage and extract links
curl -s "$1" | grep -oP '(?<=href=")[^"]*'
EOF
```

Thought: The `extract_links.sh` script has been successfully created. Now, I will make the script executable.

Thought: The `extract_links.sh` script is now executable. To ensure the script works correctly, I will run it with a test URL to extract links from a webpage.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME/HtmlExtractScript [&&/] ./extract_links.sh https://example.com > test_output.log 2>&1 &
```


Observation: Changed directory to: /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/HtmlExtractScript
Started background process: ./extract_links.sh https://example.com > test_output.log 2>&1 in /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/HtmlExtractScript
Thought: To validate that the script executed correctly and extracted the links, I will check the contents of the `test_output.log` file.
ActionType: Validate
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME/HtmlExtractScript [&&/] tail -n 20 test_output.log

	[--context[=num]] [--directories=action] [--label] [--line-buffered]
	[--null] [pattern] [file ...]
Thought: The `grep` command used in the script does not support the `-P` option for Perl-compatible regular expressions on MacOS. I will modify the script to use a different approach to extract links using `sed` instead of `grep -oP`.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME/HtmlExtractScript [&&/] cat << 'EOF' > extract_links.sh
#!/bin/bash
# Check if URL is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <URL>"
  exit 1

# Fetch the webpage and extract links
curl -s "$1" | sed -n 's/.*href="\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p'
EOF
