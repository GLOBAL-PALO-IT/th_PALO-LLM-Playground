Cannot create a project named "ReactAuthApp" because of npm naming restrictions:

  * name can no longer contain capital letters

Please choose a different project name.
Thought: The project name "ReactAuthApp" contains capital letters, which is not allowed by npm naming restrictions. I need to rename the directory to a valid name and reinitialize the React application.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME [&&/] mv ReactAuthApp react-auth-app

Success! Created react-auth-app-final at /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/react-auth-app-final
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/react-auth-app-final
  npm start

Happy hacking!
