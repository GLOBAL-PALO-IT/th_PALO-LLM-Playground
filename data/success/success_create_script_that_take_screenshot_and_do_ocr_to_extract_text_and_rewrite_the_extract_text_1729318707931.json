[{"role":"system","content":"You are a human wish to bash script generator for MacOS.\nInstruction: the input instruction you must answer\n\nTo solve the instruction you must interleave between Thought, Action, Observation iterations. \n\n- Here is the execution template:\nThought: you should always think about what to do next in a single bash command\nActionType: the action type which are either executed/validate\n    - Execute: a bash command to execute the task\n    - Validate: a bash command to validate the task previously executed\n    - Both Execute and Validate are alternating, starting with Execute then Validate then Execute and so on\n    - After ActionType: Execute, you must follow by ActionType: Validate in the next iteration\nAction: a single bash command to execute the task(with cd command if necessary). The command must follow these rules:\n    - one bash command per Action not multiple commands\n    - DON'T install software dependency is it's already installed\n    - Before run the command that involve software installation, you must check if the software is already installed\n    - The command must not be a command that requires user input, command must be non-interactive(These commands can be run non-interactively by using flags like --force, -y, or --quiet to bypass prompts.)\n        -- for example: \n            --- echo \"yes\" | your_command\n            --- your_command -y\n            --- your_command --force\n            --- npx create-next-app my-app --yes\n            --- apt-get update -y\n            --- npm install -g typescript --force\n            --- docker run -d --name my-container nginx\n            --- git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git --quiet\n            --- rm -rf /path/to/folder --force\n    - do not use cd command alone, always use cd with && to change directory and run the command in the same line because each command runs in a separate shell\n    - The command must skip any confirmation prompt\n    - If the command is long running process, like npm start, npx create-[], server start up, dependency installation, project initialization: you must put the command in the background with & at the end of the command\n        - your_command > logfile-TaskName.log 2>&1 &\n        - for example: your_command > logfile-TaskName.log 2>&1 &\n        - After the command is executed, you must execute delay command for 15 seconds to wait for the process to start up completely before validating the task with `sleep 15`\n        - To validate the command, you must check the logfile-TaskName.log using `cd [correct directory] && tail -n 20 logfile-TaskName.log` to see the last 20 lines of the log file at the right directory\n    - If the command has server port conflict, you must change the port to a random port, do not kill existing process\n    - If the command is involve with file and folder manipulation, always check existence of the file/folder before creating/edit/deleting\n    - If the folder already exists, use different folder name    \n    - If the command is involve with file content manipulation, use cat << 'EOF'(use added single quotes around 'EOF' to treat the content literally and not to interpret any special characters) instead of echo to avoid escaping issue\nChildProcess: the nodejs child_process mode that the bash must run either spawn/exec. ChildProcess must follow these rules:\n    - spawn: the command must run in the background(If the task is long running process/ end with &, you must use spawn)\n    - exec: the command must run in the foreground\nStatus: the status of the task which are either Success, Stopped, Failed, In Progress. The status must follow these rules:\n    - Success: the task is validated and completed successfully\n    - Stopped: the task is stopped because it's stuck in a loop\n    - Failed: the task is failed because the bash command is incorrect\n    - In Progress: the task is still in progress and not validated yet\nObservation: the result of the bash command\n    \n... (this Thought/ActionType/Action/ChildProcess/Status/Observation can repeat N times)\n\n- When the task is done, you must end with a Thought: The task is done. Status: Completed\nThought: The task is done. Status: Completed\n- When the task is stuck in a loop, you must end with a Thought: The task is done. Status: Stuck\nThought: The task is done. Status: Stuck\n\nOutput in JSON format\n[{\n\"Thought\": string,\n\"ActionType\": string,\n\"Action\": string,\n\"ChildProcess\": string,\n\"Status\": string,\n}]\n"},{"role":"user","content":"Instruction: Create script that take screenshot and do ocr to extract text and rewrite the extract text"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"Thought\":\"First, I need to check if the 'screencapture' command is available for taking screenshots on MacOS.\",\"ActionType\":\"Execute\",\"Action\":\"command -v screencapture\",\"Status\":\"In Progress\",\"ChildProcess\":\"exec\"}"},{"role":"user","content":"Observation: /usr/sbin/screencapture"},{"role":"assistant","content":"{\"Thought\":\"The 'screencapture' command is available.
