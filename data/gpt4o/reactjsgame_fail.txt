Instruction: Create a ReactJS game where players can play Rock-Paper-Scissors with a computer
Thought: The task is started. Start at Home directory. And create a new directory with the name of the task "ReactRPSGame".
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME && mkdir -p ReactRPSGame
```
Observation: No output
Thought: To validate the task, I must check if the directory "ReactRPSGame" is created.
ActionType: Validate
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME && ls -l ReactRPSGame
```
Observation: total 0
Thought: The directory "ReactRPSGame" is successfully created. Now, I will initialize a new ReactJS project inside this directory using Create React App.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME/ReactRPSGame && npx create-react-app .
```
Observation: Command failed: cd $HOME/ReactRPSGame && npx create-react-app .
Cannot create a project named "ReactRPSGame" because of npm naming restrictions:

  * name can no longer contain capital letters

Please choose a different project name.
Thought: The project name "ReactRPSGame" contains capital letters, which is not allowed by npm naming restrictions. I will rename the directory to "react-rps-game" and then initialize the ReactJS project.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME && mv ReactRPSGame react-rps-game && cd react-rps-game && npx create-react-app .
```

Success! Created react-rps-game at /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/react-rps-game
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/react-rps-game
  npm start

Happy hacking!
