Error executing command in /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/ReactTankGame: Command failed: npx create-react-app .
Cannot create a project named "ReactTankGame" because of npm naming restrictions:

  * name can no longer contain capital letters

Please choose a different project name.
Thought: The directory name "ReactTankGame" contains capital letters, which is not allowed by npm naming restrictions. I will rename the directory to "react-tank-game" and then initialize the React project.

Success! Created react-tank-game at /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/react-tank-game
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/react-tank-game
  npm start

Happy hacking!
