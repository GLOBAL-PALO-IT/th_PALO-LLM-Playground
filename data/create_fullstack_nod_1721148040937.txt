Instruction: Create fullstack nodejs typescript project that has react frontend and express backend that demonstrate login and register api
Thought: The task is started. Start at Home directory. And create a new directory with the name of the task.
ActionType: Execute
Action: ```bash
cd $HOME [&&/] mkdir -p FullstackNodeTsProject

Thought: The Node.js project has been initialized. Next, I will install the necessary dependencies for both the backend (Express) and frontend (React) along with TypeScript.

ActionType: Execute

Created git commit.

Success! Created client at /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/FullstackNodeTsProject/client
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  npm start
    Starts the development server.

  npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  cd client
  npm start

Happy hacking!
We detected TypeScript in your project (src/App.test.tsx) and created a tsconfig.json file for you.
Thought: The necessary dependencies for both the backend (Express) and frontend (React) along with TypeScript have been installed. Next, I will set up the TypeScript configuration for the backend and create the basic folder structure.

app.use('/login', loginRoute);
app.use('/register', registerRoute);

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
