Thought: Both `wget` and `pandoc` are installed. Next, I need to create a script that will download a webpage, extract its content, and convert it to a Markdown file. I will start by creating a script file.

ActionType: Execute
Action: 
```bash
cd $HOME/WebpageToMarkdown [&&/] cat << 'EOF' > extract_to_markdown.sh
#!/bin/bash

# Check if URL is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 <URL>"
  exit 1
fi

URL=$1
HTML_FILE="webpage.html"
MD_FILE="webpage.md"

# Download the webpage
wget -q -O $HTML_FILE $URL

# Convert HTML to Markdown
pandoc $HTML_FILE -f html -t markdown -o $MD_FILE

# Clean up
rm $HTML_FILE

echo "Markdown file created: $MD_FILE"
EOF
```
