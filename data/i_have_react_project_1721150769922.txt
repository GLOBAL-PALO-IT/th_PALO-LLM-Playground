Error executing command in /Users/sarinsuriyakoon/react-tank-game: Command failed: npx playwright test tests/tank-game.spec.js
Thought: The Playwright test command failed. This could be due to the server not running. I will start the React development server on a random port to avoid any port conflicts and then rerun the Playwright test.
