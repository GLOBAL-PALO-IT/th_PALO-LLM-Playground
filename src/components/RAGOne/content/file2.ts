3 GRI 305: Emissions 2016Introduction
GRI 305: Emissions 2016 contains disclosures for organizations to report information about their emissions-related
impacts, and how they manage these impacts.
The Standard is structured as follows:
The rest of the Introduction section provides a background on the topic, an overview of the system of GRI Standards
and further information on using this Standard.
Background on the topic
This Standard addresses emissions into air, which are the discharge of substances from a source into the
atmosphere. Types of emissions include: greenhouse gas (GHG), ozone-depleting substances (ODS), and nitrogen
oxides (NO ) and sulfur oxides (SO ), among other significant air emissions.
GHG emissions
GHG emissions are a major contributor to climate change and are governed by the United Nations (UN) ‘Framework
Convention on Climate Change’ and the subsequent UN ‘Kyoto Protocol’.
This Standard covers the following GHGs:
Some GHGs, including methane, are also air pollutants that have significant negative impacts on ecosystems, air
quality, agriculture, and human and animal health.
As a result, different national and international regulations and incentive systems, such as emissions trading, aim to
control the volume and reward the reduction of GHG emissions.
The requirements for GHG emissions in this Standard are based on the requirements of the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate
Accounting and Reporting Standard’ (‘GHG Protocol Corporate Standard’) and the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Value
Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard’ (‘GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard’). These two
standards are part of the GHG Protocol developed by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business
Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD).
The GHG Protocol has established a classification of GHG emissions called 'Scope': Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3.
The GHG emissions standard published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), ‘ISO 14064’,
represents these classifications of Scope with the following terms:
In this Standard, these terms are combined in the following way, as defined in the Glossary section:
Section 1 contains requirements, which provide information about how the organization manages its emissionsrelated impacts.
•
Section 2 contains seven disclosures, which provide information about the organization’s emissions-related
impacts.
•
The Glossary contains defined terms with a specific meaning when used in the GRI Standards. The terms are
underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to the definitions.
•
The Bibliography lists authoritative intergovernmental instruments and additional references used in developing
this Standard.

4 GRI 305: Emissions 2016Ozone-depleting substances (ODS)
The ozone layer filters out most of the sun’s biologically harmful ultraviolet (UV-B) radiation. Observed and projected
ozone depletion due to ODS generates worldwide concern. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) ‘Montreal
Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer’ (‘Montreal Protocol’) regulates the phase-out of ODS
internationally.
Nitrogen oxides (NO ), sulfur oxides (SO ), and other significant air emissions
Pollutants such as NO and SO have negative impacts on climate, ecosystems, air quality, habitats, agriculture, and
human and animal health. Deterioration of air quality, acidification, forest degradation and public health concerns
have led to local and international regulations to control emissions of these pollutants.
Reductions in the emission of regulated pollutants lead to improved health conditions for workers and local
communities and can enhance relations with affected stakeholders. In regions with emission caps, the volume of
emissions also has direct cost implications.
Other significant air emissions include, for example, persistent organic pollutants or particulate matter, as well as air
emissions that are regulated under international conventions and/or national laws or regulations, including those
listed on an organization’s environmental permits.
System of GRI Standards
This Standard is part of the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards). The GRI Standards enable an
organization to report information about its most significant impacts on the economy, environment, and people,
including impacts on their human rights, and how it manages these impacts.
The GRI Standards are structured as a system of interrelated standards that are organized into three series: GRI
Universal Standards, GRI Sector Standards, and GRI Topic Standards (see Figure 1 in this Standard).
Universal Standards: GRI 1, GRI 2 and GRI 3
GRI 1: Foundation 2021 specifies the requirements that the organization must comply with to report in accordance
with the GRI Standards. The organization begins using the GRI Standards by consulting GRI 1.
GRI 2: General Disclosures 2021 contains disclosures that the organization uses to provide information about its
reporting practices and other organizational details, such as its activities, governance, and policies.
GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 provides guidance on how to determine material topics. It also contains disclosures that
the organization uses to report information about its process of determining material topics, its list of material topics,
and how it manages each topic.
Sector Standards
The Sector Standards provide information for organizations about their likely material topics. The organization uses
the Sector Standards that apply to its sectors when determining its material topics and when determining what to
report for each material topic.
Topic Standards
The Topic Standards contain disclosures that the organization uses to report information about its impacts in relation
to particular topics. The organization uses the Topic Standards according to the list of material topics it has
determined using GRI 3.

Using this Standard
This Standard can be used by any organization – regardless of size, type, sector, geographic location, or reporting
experience – to report information about its emissions-related impacts.
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report the following disclosures if it has
determined emissions to be a material topic:
See Requirements 4 and 5 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021.
Reasons for omission are permitted for these requirements and disclosures.
If the organization cannot comply with a disclosure or with a requirement in a disclosure (e.g., because the required
information is confidential or subject to legal prohibitions), the organization is required to specify the disclosure or the
requirement it cannot comply with, and provide a reason for omission together with an explanation in the GRI content
index. See Requirement 6 in GRI 1: Foundation 2021 for more information on reasons for omission.
If the organization cannot report the required information about an item specified in a disclosure because the item
(e.g., committee, policy, practice, process) does not exist, it can comply with the requirement by reporting this to be the
case. The organization can explain the reasons for not having this item, or describe any plans to develop it. The
disclosure does not require the organization to implement the item (e.g., developing a policy), but to report that the
item does not exist.
If the organization intends to publish a standalone sustainability report, it does not need to repeat information that it
has already reported publicly elsewhere, such as on web pages or in its annual report. In such a case, the
organization can report a required disclosure by providing a reference in the GRI content index as to where this
information can be found (e.g., by providing a link to the web page or citing the page in the annual report where the
information has been published).
• Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this Standard);
• Clause 1.2 in this Standard, if it is relevant to its emissions-related impacts;
Any disclosures from this Topic Standard that are relevant to the organization’s emissions-related impacts
(Disclosure 305-1 through Disclosure 305-7).
•
6 GRI 305: Emissions 2016Requirements, guidance and defined terms
The following apply throughout this Standard:
Requirements are presented in bold font and indicated by the word 'shall'. An organization must comply with
requirements to report in accordance with the GRI Standards.
Requirements may be accompanied by guidance.
Guidance includes background information, explanations, and examples to help the organization better understand
the requirements. The organization is not required to comply with guidance.
The Standards may also include recommendations. These are cases where a particular course of action is
encouraged but not required.
The word ‘should’ indicates a recommendation, and the word ‘can’ indicates a possibility or option.
Defined terms are underlined in the text of the GRI Standards and linked to their definitions in the Glossary. The
organization is required to apply the definitions in the Glossary.
7 GRI 305: Emissions 20161. Topic management disclosures
An organization reporting in accordance with the GRI Standards is required to report how it manages each of its
material topics.
An organization that has determined emissions to be a material topic is required to report how it manages the topic
using Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (see clause 1.1 in this section). The organization is also required
to report clause 1.2 in this section, if it is relevant to its emissions-related impacts.
This section is therefore designed to supplement – and not replace – Disclosure 3-3 in GRI 3.
REQUIREMENTS The reporting organization shall report how it manages emissions using Disclosure 3-
3 in GRI 3: Material Topics 2021.
1.1
When reporting on GHG emissions targets, the reporting organization shall explain
whether offsets were used to meet the targets, including the type, amount, criteria or
scheme of which the offsets are part.
1.2
GUIDANCE The reporting organization can also:
explain whether it is subject to any country, regional, or industry-level emissions regulations
and policies; and provide examples of these regulations and policies;
•
disclose expenditures on treatment of emissions (such as expenditures for filters, agents)
and for the purchase and use of emissions certificates.
•

Guidance for Disclosure 305-1
Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions include, but are not limited to, the CO emissions from the fuel
consumption as reported in Disclosure 302-1 of GRI 302: Energy 2016.
GUIDANCE
2
9 GRI 305: Emissions 2016Direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions can come from the following sources owned or controlled by
an organization:
Methodologies used to calculate the direct (Scope I) GHG emissions can include:
If estimations are used due to a lack of default figures, the reporting organization can indicate
the basis and assumptions on which figures were estimated.
For recalculations of prior year emissions, the organization can follow the approach in the ‘GHG
Protocol Corporate Standard’.
The chosen emission factors can originate from mandatory reporting requirements, voluntary
reporting frameworks, or industry groups.
Estimates of GWP rates change over time as scientific research develops. GWP rates from the
Second Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are used
as the basis for international negotiations under the ‘Kyoto Protocol’. Thus, such rates can be
used for disclosing GHG emissions where it does not conflict with national or regional reporting
requirements. The organization can also use the latest GWP rates from the most recent IPCC
assessment report.
The organization can combine Disclosure 305-1 with Disclosures 305-2 (energy indirect/Scope
2 GHG emissions) and 305-3 (other indirect/Scope 3 GHG emissions) to disclose total GHG
emissions.
Further details and guidance are available in the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Standard’. See also
references [1], [2], [12], [13], [14] and [19] in the Bibliography.
Generation of electricity, heating, cooling and steam: these emissions result from
combustion of fuels in stationary sources, such as boilers, furnaces, and turbines – and
from other combustion processes such as flaring;
•
Physical or chemical processing: most of these emissions result from the manufacturing or
processing of chemicals and materials, such as cement, steel, aluminum, ammonia, and
waste processing;
•
Transportation of materials, products, waste, workers, and passengers: these emissions
result from the combustion of fuels in mobile combustion sources owned or controlled by
the organization, such as trucks, trains, ships, airplanes, buses, and cars;
•
Fugitive emissions: these are emissions that are not physically controlled but result from
intentional or unintentional releases of GHGs. These can include equipment leaks from
joints, seals, packing, and gaskets; methane emissions (e.g., from coal mines) and venting;
HFC emissions from refrigeration and air conditioning equipment; and methane leakages
(e.g., from gas transport).
•
direct measurement of energy source consumed (coal, gas) or losses (refills) of cooling
systems and conversion to GHG (CO2 equivalents);
•
• mass balance calculations;
• calculations based on site-specific data, such as for fuel composition analysis;
• calculations based on published criteria, such as emission factors and GWP rates;
• direct measurements of GHG emissions, such as continuous online analyzers;
• estimations.

2.4.5.2 country;
2.4.5.3 type of source (electricity, heating, cooling, and steam);
11 GRI 305: Emissions 20162.4.5.4 type of activity.
Guidance for Disclosure 305-2
Energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions include, but are not limited to, the CO2 emissions
from the generation of purchased or acquired electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumed
by an organization – disclosed as specified in Disclosure 302-1 of GRI 302: Energy 2016. For
many organizations, the energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions that result from the
generation of purchased electricity can be much greater than their direct (Scope 1) GHG
emissions.
The ‘GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance’ requires organizations to provide two distinct Scope 2
values: a location-based and a market-based value. A location- based method reflects the
average GHG emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs, using mostly
grid-average emission factor data. A market-based method reflects emissions from electricity
that an organization has purposefully chosen (or its lack of choice). It derives emission factors
from contractual instruments, which include any type of contract between two parties for the sale
and purchase of energy bundled with attributes about the energy generation, or for unbundled
attribute claims.
The market-based method calculation also includes the use of a residual mix, if the organization
does not have specified emissions-intensity from its contractual instruments. This helps prevent
double counting between consumers’ market-based method figures. If a residual mix is
unavailable, the organization can disclose this and use grid-average emission factors as a
proxy (which can mean that the location-based and market- based are the same number until
information on the residual mix is available).
The reporting organization can apply the Quality Criteria in the ‘GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance’
so that contractual instruments convey GHG emission rate claims and to prevent double
counting. See reference [18] in the Bibliography.
For recalculations of prior year emissions, the organization can follow the approach in the ‘GHG
Protocol Corporate Standard’.
The chosen emission factors can originate from mandatory reporting requirements, voluntary
reporting frameworks, or industry groups.
Estimates of GWP rates change over time as scientific research develops. GWP rates from the
Second Assessment Report of the IPCC are used as the basis for international negotiations
under the ‘Kyoto Protocol’. Thus, such rates can be used for disclosing GHG emissions where it
does not conflict with national or regional reporting requirements. The organization can also use
the latest GWP rates from the most recent IPCC assessment report.
The organization can combine Disclosure 305-2 with Disclosures 305-1 (direct/Scope 1 GHG
emissions) and 305-3 (other indirect/Scope 3 GHG emissions) to disclose total GHG
emissions.
Further details and guidance are available in the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Standard’. Details on
the location-based and market-based methods are available in the ‘GHG Protocol Scope 2
Guidance’. See also references [1], [2], [12], [13], [14] and [18] in the Bibliography.

13 GRI 305: Emissions 2016Guidance for Disclosure 305-3
Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions are a consequence of an organization’s activities, but
occur from sources not owned or controlled by the organization. Other indirect (Scope 3) GHG
emissions include both upstream and downstream emissions. Some examples of Scope 3
activities include extracting and producing purchased materials; transporting purchased fuels in
vehicles not owned or controlled by the organization; and the end use of products and services.
Other indirect emissions can also come from the decomposing of the organization’s waste.
Process-related emissions during the manufacture of purchased goods and fugitive emissions
in facilities not owned by the organization can also produce indirect emissions.
For some organizations, GHG emissions that result from energy consumption outside of the
organization can be much greater than their direct (Scope 1) or energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG
emissions.
The reporting organization can identify other indirect (Scope 3) GHG emissions by assessing
which of its activities’ emissions:
The organization can use the following upstream and downstream categories and activities
from the ‘GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard’ (see reference [15] in the
Bibliography).
Upstream categories
1. Purchased goods and services
2. Capital goods
3. Fuel- and energy-related activities (not included in Scope 1 or Scope 2)
4. Upstream transportation and distribution
5. Waste generated in operations
6. Business travel
7. Employee commuting
8. Upstream leased assets
Other upstream
Downstream categories
9. Downstream transportation and distribution
10. Processing of sold products
11. Use of sold products
12. End-of-life treatment of sold products
13. Downstream leased assets
14. Franchises
15. Investments
Other downstream
For each of these categories and activities, the organization can provide a figure in CO
equivalent or explain why certain data are not included.
For recalculations of prior year emissions, the organization can follow the approach in the ‘GHG
Protocol Corporate Value Chain Standard’.

this intensity ratio separately from the intensity ratios for direct (Scope 1) and
energy indirect (Scope 2) emissions.
2.7.2
RECOMMENDATIONS When compiling the information specified in Disclosure 305-4, the reporting organization
should, where it aids transparency or comparability over time, provide a breakdown of the
GHG emissions intensity ratio by:
2.8
2.8.1 business unit or facility;
2.8.2 country;
2.8.3 type of source;
2.8.4 type of activity.
Guidance for Disclosure 305-4
Intensity ratios can be provided for, among others:
Organization-specific metrics (denominators) can include:
The reporting organization can report an intensity ratio for direct (Scope 1) and energy indirect
(Scope 2) GHG emissions combined, using the figures reported in Disclosures 305-1 and 305-
2.
Background
Intensity ratios define GHG emissions in the context of an organization-specific metric. Many
organizations track environmental performance with intensity ratios, which are often called
normalized environmental impact data.
GHG emissions intensity expresses the amount of GHG emissions per unit of activity, output, or
any other organization-specific metric. In combination with an organization’s absolute GHG
emissions, reported in Disclosures 305-1, 305-2, and 305-3, GHG emissions intensity helps to
contextualize the organization’s efficiency, including in relation to other organizations.

Background
Measuring ODS production, imports, and exports helps to indicate how an organization
complies with legislation. This is particularly relevant if the organization produces or uses ODS
in its processes, products and services and is subject to phase-out commitments. Results on
ODS phase-out help to indicate the organization’s position in any markets affected by regulation
on ODS.
This disclosure covers the substances included in Annexes A, B, C, and E of the ‘Montreal
GUIDANCE
19 GRI 305: Emissions 2016Protocol’ as well as any other ODS produced, imported, or exported by an organization.

21 GRI 305: Emissions 2016Glossary
This glossary provides definitions for terms used in this Standard. The organization is required to apply these
definitions when using the GRI Standards.
The definitions included in this glossary may contain terms that are further defined in the complete GRI Standards
Glossary. All defined terms are underlined. If a term is not defined in this glossary or in the complete GRI Standards
Glossary, definitions that are commonly used and understood apply.
base year
historical datum (such as year) against which a measurement is tracked over time
baseline
starting point used for comparisons
Note: In the context of energy and emissions reporting, the baseline is the projected
energy consumption or emissions in the absence of any reduction activity.
biogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emission
emission of CO
2 from the combustion or biodegradation of biomass
carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent
measure used to compare the emissions from various types of greenhouse gas (GHG) based
on their global warming potential (GWP)
Note: The CO
2 equivalent for a gas is determined by multiplying the metric tons of the gas
by the associated GWP.
CFC11 (trichlorofluoromethane) equivalent
measure used to compare various substances based on their relative ozone depletion potential
(ODP)
Note: The reference level of 1 is the potential of CFC-11 (trichlorofluoromethane) and
CFC-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane) to cause ozone depletion.
direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from sources that are owned or controlled by the
organization
Examples: CO2 emissions from fuel consumption
Note: A GHG source is any physical unit or process that releases GHG into the
atmosphere.
energy indirect (Scope 2) GHG emissions
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that result from the generation of purchased or acquired
electricity, heating, cooling, and steam consumed by the organization
global warming potential (GWP)
value describing the radiative forcing impact of one unit of a given greenhouse gas (GHG)
relative to one unit of CO
2 over a given period of time
Note: GWP values convert GHG emissions data for non-CO
2 gases into units of CO2
equivalent.
greenhouse gas (GHG)
gas that contributes to the greenhouse effect by absorbing infrared radiation
greenhouse gas (GHG) trade
purchase, sale or transfer of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission offsets or allowances

on ‘human rights’.
impact
effect the organization has or could have on the economy, environment, and people, including on
their human rights, which in turn can indicate its contribution (negative or positive) to sustainable
development
Note 1: Impacts can be actual or potential, negative or positive, short-term or long-term,
intended or unintended, and reversible or irreversible.

hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), halons, and methyl bromide.
reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or increase in removal or storage of GHG from
the atmosphere, relative to baseline emissions
Note: Primary effects will result in GHG reductions, as will some secondary effects. An
initiative’s total GHG reductions are quantified as the sum of its associated primary
effect(s) and any significant secondary effects (which may involve decreases or
countervailing increases in GHG emissions).
scope of GHG emissions
classification of the operational boundaries where greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions occur
Note 1: Scope classifies whether GHG emissions are created by the organization itself, or
are created by other related organizations, for example electricity suppliers or
logistics companies.
Note 2: There are three classifications of Scope: Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3.
Note 3: The classification of Scope derives from the World Resources Institute (WRI) and
World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), GHG Protocol
Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition, 2004.
