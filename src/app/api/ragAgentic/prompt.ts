For each step:
1. Provide a clear, specific description of what needs to be done
2. Include the exact search query that would yield the most relevant information
3. Explain briefly why this step and search query are necessary

Your plan should be comprehensive enough to solve the problem completely, but avoid unnecessary steps. Include contingency steps for potential roadblocks where appropriate.

Format your response in markdown as follows:

# Question: a question you must plan to answer

# Step-by-Step Solution Plan

## Step 1: [Concise action title]
**Task:** [Detailed description of what needs to be done]
**Search Query:** "[Specific, optimized search query]"
**Rationale:** [Brief explanation of why this step is necessary]

## Step 2: [Concise action title]
**Task:** [Detailed description of what needs to be done]
**Search Query:** "[Specific, optimized search query]"
**Rationale:** [Brief explanation of why this step is necessary]

[Continue with additional steps as needed]

## Final Step: [Verification/implementation title]
**Task:** [How to verify the solution works or implement final actions]
**Search Query:** "[Final verification query if needed]"
**Rationale:** [Why this verification/implementation matters]

### Instructions:
1. Analyze the provided context and the question.
2. Determine the relationship between them based on the following categories:
   - **RELEVANT**: The context directly answers or provides crucial information for the question.
   - **SUPPORT**: The context contains useful background information but does not fully answer the question.
   - **NOT RELEVANT**: The context does not help in answering the question.

### Data:
- **Context:** ${context}

### Instructions:
1. Carefully analyze the context and the question.
2. Think step by step, considering:
   - What information the question seeks.
   - What information the context provides.
   - Whether the context fully answers, partially supports, or is unrelated to the question.
3. Clearly explain your reasoning step by step before giving the final classification.

### Data:
- **Context:** ${context}
- **Question:** ${question}

### Output Format:
First, provide a structured step-by-step reasoning process explaining your analysis.  
Then, output your final classification as follows:

#Result
* **RELEVANT**: The context directly answers or provides crucial information for the question.
OR
* **SUPPORT**: The context contains useful background information but does not fully answer the question.
OR
* **NOT RELEVANT**: The context does not help in answering the question.`;

Give your answer on a scale of 1 to 4, where 1 means that the answer is not helpful at all, and 4 means that the answer completely and helpfully addresses the question.

Here is the scale you should use to build your answer:
1: The answer is terrible: completely irrelevant to the question asked, or very partial
2: The answer is mostly not helpful: misses some key aspects of the question
3: The answer is mostly helpful: provides support, but still could be improved
4: The answer is excellent: relevant, direct, detailed, and addresses all the concerns raised in the question

Provide your feedback as follows:

# Feedback
- Evaluation: (your rationale for the rating, as a text)
