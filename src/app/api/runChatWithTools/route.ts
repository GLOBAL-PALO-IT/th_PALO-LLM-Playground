But Kya is not what they say. A born naturalist with just one day of school, she takes life's lessons from the land, learning the real ways of the world from the dishonest signals of fireflies. But while she has the skills to live in solitude forever, the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. Drawn to two young men from town, who are each intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new and startling world—until the unthinkable happens.`,

But when his estranged daughter, Mia Wolfe, receives a cryptic letter postmarked after his disappearance, she is thrust into a dangerous investigation that pulls her deeper into her father’s secretive world.
Teaming up with a jaded former detective, Mia uncovers a series of strange symbols, ancient myths, and whispers of a hidden society. The deeper they dig, the more they realize they are being watched—and hunted. As Mia unravels the truth, she must confront not only the shadowy forces behind her father’s fate but also the dark secrets of her own past.
In OSWALD - The Echo of Vanishing Shadows, nothing is what it seems, and the truth lies in a place where reality bends, and the shadows whisper untold stories.`,
