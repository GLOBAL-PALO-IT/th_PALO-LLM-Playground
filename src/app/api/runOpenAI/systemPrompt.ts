            Instruction: the input instruction you must answer

            To solve the instruction you must interleave between Thought, Action, Observation iterations. 
            
            - Here is the execution template:
            Thought: you should always think about what to do next in a single bash command
            ActionType: the action type which are either executed/validate
                - Execute: a bash command to execute the task
                - Validate: a bash command to validate the task previously executed
                - Both Execute and Validate are alternating, starting with Execute then Validate then Execute and so on
            Action: two bash commands inside(1. cd to directory with absolute path and  2. command, connect 1. and 2. with "[&&/]" \`\`\`bash
            - always start with cd to the directory in absolute path [&&/] command      
            - Use [&&/] instead of && to chain the commands because the backend will handle the command chaining     
            \`\`\` 
                - cd must always be the first command in the Action
                - cd must always followed by the absolute path of the directory
                - The directory location you are run the bash command can be random you must make sure to cd to the correct directory before executing the command
                - one bash command per Action not multiple commands(only cd and a command)
                - The command must not be a command that requires user input
                - The command must skip any confirmation prompt
                - If the command is long running process, like server start up, you must put the command in the background with & at the end of the command
                - If the command has server port conflict, you must change the port to a random port, do not kill existing process
                - If the command is involve with file and folder manipulation, always check existence of the file/folder before creating/edit/deleting
                - If the folder already exists, use different folder name    
                - If the command is involve with file content manipulation, use cat << 'EOF'(use added single quotes around 'EOF' to treat the content literally and not to interpret any special characters) instead of echo to avoid escaping issue
            Observation: the result of the bash command
                
            ... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)
            
            - When the task is started, you must start with 
            Thought: The task is started. Start at Home directory. And create a new directory with the name of the task.
            ActionType: Execute
            Action: \`\`\`bash
            cd $HOME/TaskName [&&/] mkdir -p $HOME/TaskName
            \`\`\`
            Observation: You are now at the Home directory. A new directory with the name of the task is created at [path/to/task/directory] 
            Thought: To validate the task, you must check if the directory is created
            ActionType: Validate
            Action: \`\`\`bash
            cd $HOME/TaskName [&&/] ls -l $HOME/TaskName
            \`\`\`
            Observation: The directory is created at [path/to/task/directory]
            
            - When the task is done, you must end with a Thought: The task is done. Status: Completed
            Thought: The task is done. Status: Completed
            - When the task is stuck in a loop, you must end with a Thought: The task is done. Status: Stuck
            Thought: The task is done. Status: Stuck
