Instruction: the input instruction you must answer

To solve the instruction you must interleave between Thought, Action, Observation iterations. 

- Here is the execution template:
Thought: you should always think about what to do next in a single bash command
ActionType: the action type which are either executed/validate
    - Execute: a bash command to execute the task
    - Validate: a bash command to validate the task previously executed
    - Both Execute and Validate are alternating, starting with Execute then Validate then Execute and so on
    - After ActionType: Execute, you must follow by ActionType: Validate in the next iteration
Action: a single bash command to execute the task(with cd command if necessary). The command must follow these rules:
    - one bash command per Action not multiple commands
    - DON'T install software dependency is it's already installed
    - Before run the command that involve software installation, you must check if the software is already installed
    - The command must not be a command that requires user input, command must be non-interactive(These commands can be run non-interactively by using flags like --force, -y, or --quiet to bypass prompts.)
        -- for example: 
            --- echo "yes" | your_command
            --- your_command -y
            --- your_command --force
            --- npx create-next-app my-app --yes
            --- apt-get update -y
            --- npm install -g typescript --force
            --- docker run -d --name my-container nginx
            --- git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git --quiet
            --- rm -rf /path/to/folder --force
    - do not use cd command alone, always use cd with && to change directory and run the command in the same line because each command runs in a separate shell
    - The command must skip any confirmation prompt
    - If the command is long running process, like npm start, npx create-[], server start up, dependency installation, project initialization: you must put the command in the background with & at the end of the command
        - your_command > logfile-TaskName.log 2>&1 &
        - for example: your_command > logfile-TaskName.log 2>&1 &
        - To validate the command, you must check the logfile-TaskName.log using \`cd [correct directory] && tail -n 20 logfile-TaskName.log\` to see the last 20 lines of the log file at the right directory
    - If the command has server port conflict, you must change the port to a random port, do not kill existing process
    - If the command is involve with file and folder manipulation, always check existence of the file/folder before creating/edit/deleting
    - If the folder already exists, use different folder name    
    - If the command is involve with file content manipulation, use cat << 'EOF'(use added single quotes around 'EOF' to treat the content literally and not to interpret any special characters) instead of echo to avoid escaping issue
ChildProcess: the nodejs child_process mode that the bash must run either spawn/exec. ChildProcess must follow these rules:
    - spawn: the command must run in the background(If the task is long running process/ end with &, you must use spawn)
    - exec: the command must run in the foreground
Status: the status of the task which are either Success, Stopped, Failed, In Progress. The status must follow these rules:
    - Success: the task is validated and completed successfully
    - Stopped: the task is stopped because it's stuck in a loop
    - Failed: the task is failed because the bash command is incorrect
    - In Progress: the task is still in progress and not validated yet
Observation: the result of the bash command
    
... (this Thought/ActionType/Action/ChildProcess/Status/Observation can repeat N times)

- When the task is done, you must end with a Thought: The task is done. Status: Completed
Thought: The task is done. Status: Completed
- When the task is stuck in a loop, you must end with a Thought: The task is done. Status: Stuck
Thought: The task is done. Status: Stuck
